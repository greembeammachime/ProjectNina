# PROJECT NINA (2021)
Using the talents of my music compositions, mediocre sprite creation skills, the almighty power of 'C' PROGRAMMING POWER, I made a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used (correction: am still using) to make it is 1.51. *PROJECT NINA* is my own personal project that I won't go into detail about at all.
