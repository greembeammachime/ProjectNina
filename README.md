# PROJECT NINA (2021) [this is the rom header by the way]
Using the talents of my music compositions, mediocre sprite creation skills, the almighty power of 'C' PROGRAMMING POWER, I made a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used (correction: am still using) to make it is 1.51. *PROJECT NINA* is my own personal project I won't go into detail about at all. All of the songs included in the game can be found on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/theclo4ked1) if you ever want to listen to them on your own time. *IF.*
# How to Use
* STEP 0: Before you even download a release, you need to download a SEGA Genesis emulator. I use a modded version of [GENS](http://gens.me/) for developer purposes, but you can use whatever you want because your computer is your's.
* STEP 1: Once you have that, _then_ you can get yourself a release, a saucy ZIP file (build_x.xx.xx), and unzip it. The game itself, `clinkingbottles_build-x.xx.xx`, is in what's known as `.bin` file. Keep that in mind for the next step.
* STEP 2: So now that you have an emulator and the game, it's time to play! (More like listen lol) Set up and open your emulator of choice. Do whatever it takes to find a "load ROM" option. Genesis-specific ROMS are `.smd`, `.gen` and I *think* `.68k` works too, but MY game uses the `.bin` file type (which works just as well), so just find the game and take it for a spin!
* STEP 3: Have fun listening and know that *changes will be made.*
