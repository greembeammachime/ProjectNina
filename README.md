# PROJECT NINA (2021)
Using the talents of my music compositions, mediocre sprite creation skills, the almighty power of 'C' PROGRAMMING POWER, I made a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used (correction: am still using) to make it is 1.51. *PROJECT NINA* is my own personal project that I won't go into detail about at all.
# HOW TO USE THE THING!
* STEP 0: Before you even download a release, you need to download a SEGA Genesis emulator. I use a modded version of [GENS](http://gens.me/) for developer purposes, but you can use whatever you want because your computer is your's.
* STEP 1: Once you have an emulator, _only then_ can you get yourself a release. It's a saucy ZIP file (build_x.xx.xx). Unzip its contents wherever in your PC. The game itself, `clinkingbottles_build-x.xx.xx`, is in what's known as `.bin` file. Keep that in mind for the next step.
* STEP 2: So now that you have an emulator and the game, it's time to play! (More like listen lol) Set up and open your emulator of choice. Do whatever it takes to find a "load ROM" option. Genesis-specific ROMS are `.smd`, `.gen` and I *think* `.68k` works too, but MY game uses the `.bin` file type (which works just as well), so just find the game and take it for a spin!
* STEP 3: Have fun listening and know that *changes will be made.*
