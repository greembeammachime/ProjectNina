# PROJECT NINA (2021) [this is the rom header by the way]
Mainly a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used (correction: am still using) to make it is 1.51. PROJECT NINA is my own personal project I won't go into detail about at all. All of the songs included in the game can be found on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/theclo4ked1) if you ever want to listen to them on your own time. IF.
