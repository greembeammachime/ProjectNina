# ProjectNina
Mainly a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used to make it (correction: am still using) is 1.51.

# ABOUT
This is my own personal project where I intended to:
  ~Write a novel about my OC, Nina.
  ~Make a game + original soundtrack featuring her and the world she lives in.
  ~Create an animated series adaptation.
  ~Profit???
As of now (April 2020), I'm stuck between the first and second plans, but so far I haven't given up! Right now
