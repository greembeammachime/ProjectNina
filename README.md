# PROJECT NINA (2021) [this is the rom header by the way]
Using the talents of my music compositions, mediocre sprite creation skills, the almighty power of 'C' PROGRAMMING POWER, I made a VGM Player created from the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) that I started back in September 2020. The version of SGDK I used (correction: am still using) to make it is 1.51. *PROJECT NINA* is my own personal project I won't go into detail about at all. All of the songs included in the game can be found on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/theclo4ked1) if you ever want to listen to them on your own time. *IF.*
# Credits
All programming, music, in-game visuals are made by ME, except...
* The moon image taken from one of the SGDK tutorials on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki/Tuto-Background).
* A VGM file taken from SGDK's `sample\sprite` folder.
